# Example Project

This is a Sass project that uses Fonzie. Lets build it. Make sure you have [fonzie/fonzie](Fonzie) installed.

### Step 1

Change into the directory of this project and type:

```
fonzie install
```

This will install all of the dependencies in the `component.json` file.

### Step 2

Have a look inside `master.scss` and you'll see we've imported all of the packages we want. You
now have access to all of those packages you just installed.

### Step 3

```
fonzie build
```

The project will be built into `build/build.css`.
